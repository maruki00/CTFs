# guess (crypto 300)

Guess is a math challenge wherein a service gives you a limited number of questions to determine the value of 32 random bytes (and grants you the flag if you beat this game).

### Step 1: Reverse it!

The main logic of the service is written in a series of mmx instructions, which takes some care to reverse. Here's what the service does:

1. Proof of work

2. Takes 32 bytes from /dev/urandom, treated as a vector of 32 signed 8-bit integers.

3. Takes 32 bytes of user input, xors it with with the random vector.

4. Gets the 32-bit signed sum of the elements of this xored vector (i.e. addition does NOT wrap modulo 256).

5. Returns to the user whether or not that sum is zero.

6. Steps 3, 5, 6 repeat for a total of 256 times, and then the service asks you to provide the original random vector.


In pseudocode:

    # proof of work omitted
    randvec = [randint(0, 255) for i in range(32)]
    for _ in range(256):
      xoredvec = [ord(c) ^ i for i, c in zip(randvec,raw_input())]
      x = sum((i if i < 128 else i-256) for i in xoredvec)
      print "Yep" if x == 0 else "Nope"
    if all(ord(c) == i for i, c in zip(randvec,raw_input())):
      print open("./flag").read()

### Step 2: Get flag.

Our strategy for playing this game is described below, and implemented in the attached file `guess.py`.

0. Definitions:
    * "Yes": A response from the server that the computed sum was zero.
    * "No": A response from the server that the computed sum was nonzero.
    * x thru y: Integers from x to y, inclusive.
    * `V`: The random vector we are trying to determine.
    * `V[n][m]`: The `m`th bit (0 thru 7) of the `n`th (0 thru 31) element of `V`. `m=0` is the LSB, `m=7` is the sign bit.
    * `G(x/y, z/w, ...)`: Play the game, submitting a query vector that is zeros aside from: bit `y` of byte `x`, bit `w` of byte `z`, .... These bits are set high.
    * `X`: The xored vector, between `V` and some user-supplied vector. (This is what gets summed element-wise to determine "Yes" or "No").

1. Repeatedly re-connect to the service, and wait until sending 32 null bytes gives us a "Yes". This happens with probability ~1/1000, so we don't have to wait too long.

2. We assume that `V[0][0] == 0` (we'll be right with 50% probability), and then use the following facts to determine `V[0 thru 31][0 thru 6]` (i.e. everything but the sign bits). This takes a total of 31 * 7 + 6 = 223 queries (31 * 7 applications of the first fact to test bit equality for a particular bit position across all bytes, and 6 applications of the second to test bit equality between different bit positions across any bytes).
    * For `0 <= m <= 6`, `G(x/m, y/m)` is "No" iff `V[x][m] == V[y][m]`.
    * For `0 <= m <= 5` and `V[x][m] == V[y][m]` and distinct `x, y, z`, `G(x/m, y/m, z/(m+1))` is "Yes" iff `V[z][m+1] == V[y][m]`.

3. We assume that `V[0][7] == 0` (i.e. the sign bit), and then test bit equality between all the signbits in 32 queries using the following technique to test if the signbits `V[x][7]` and `V[y][7]` are equal:
    1. Use our knowledge of all the non-sign bits to prepare a query such that `X[x][0 thru 6] == 0` and `X[y][0 thru 6] == 0x7F`, while simultaneously maintaining that the query will certainly be a "Yes" (by effectively doing adds or subtracts to other elements of `X` to balance out the mentioned changes; see the code for more detail). This means that `X[x]` is either 0 or -128, and `X[y]` is either 127 or -1.
    2. We run a `G(x/7, y/7, <the prepared query from above>)` (i.e. we do the above but also flip the sign bits of `x` and `y`). Based on the fact that "(0 or -128) plus (127 or -1)" can either equal zero or nonzero depending on what's being added, we see that `V[x][7] == V[y][7]` iff the query is "No".

4. In total, we've determined all the bytes using 255 queries, assuming knowledge of 2 bits. Since due to step 1 this method applies to only every thousandth connection, it takes an expected 4000 connections to win the game and recover the flag (for us, it took ~5000 connections once we got our script debugged).

### Caveats

1. The challenge allows for multiple attempts per proof-of-work, which you could use to be more efficient with connections. We didn't implement this.

2. The challenge doesn't allow submitting all null bytes as a query (but the method above uses this). We worked around this by xoring the last byte of every query with 0xFF, which avoids this issue and happens to not break our method at all.
