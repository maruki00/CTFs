## Revenge of Welcome

We are basically given a account to ssh into and it throws us into vim insert mode. Doing `Ctrl-l` sends us into `Normal` mode (because `<esc>` didn't work due to `vim -y`) and from there doing `!sh` gives us the shell and flag.

`hitcon{accidentally enter vim -y and can't leave Q_Q}`
