# EV3 Player

We're given a `.pklg` file: a bluetooth packetlogger capture, presumably
between a computer and a Lego Mindstorms EV3 robot.

We also have a YouTube video where the robot is speaking the first part of the
flag.

We imported the file into Audacity as unsigned 8-bit PCM with sample rate 8000Hz
and listened to the flag.
